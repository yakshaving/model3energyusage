# Tesla Model 3 energy tracker

Aggregating real world data from Model 3 energy usage.   After discussing with drivers and even the Tesla SC / techs / engineering,  I'm realizing that there's very little consensus on how much energy the 3 should be using.  In order to hit a 310 mile range, consumption needs to technically be ~241 Wh/mi.  I've been noticing that it's quite a bit higher than that on average, so I'm curious to know what others are getting.   Thanks for your help in advance.
